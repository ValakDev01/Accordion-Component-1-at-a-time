# Accordion Component (1 at a time) Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This project is a React-based accordion component for displaying FAQs. The App component renders an Accordion that manages which FAQ item is open. Each AccordionItem shows a question and, when clicked, reveals or hides its answer. Only one item is open at a time, with a number, title, and icon indicating the open or closed state. The component provides a clean, user-friendly interface for navigating through FAQ content.
